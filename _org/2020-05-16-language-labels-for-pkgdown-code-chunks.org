pkgdown nicely renders code chunks in your package's documentation
website. However, if you mix in non-R code snippets in your articles, it is
difficult to distinguish R code chunks from those written in other
languages. How nice would it be if each code chunk would have a small label to
indicate its content's language.

[[https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/][pkgdown]] is super useful for documenting your R packages. It is particularly well
suited to showcase small code examples. In some of my projects, on top of R code
chunks, I also provide code examples in other languages such as short Linux
command line code snippets I used to preprocess data before loading it into R.

pkgdown renders code chunks in most common languages nicely, with syntax
highlighting, etc. However, it does not indicate what language is used in a
particular code chunk. For most projects, this is not a problem, because all
code chunks are R code anyway. But this behavior gets confusing when we mix
different languages in the same document.

To solve this issue, I wrote a small javascript hook that adds small labels to
each code chunk, indicating the language of its content. The hook comprises a
short jQuery function and some CSS instructions. Simply add the two snippets
below to your =pkgdown/extra.js= and =pkgdown/extra.css= to add the labels to
your pkgdown projects.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
// add to extra.js
function addLang( jQuery ) {
    $("div.sourceCode").each(function(i, v){
        var lang = $(this).children("pre").attr("class").split(' ').pop()
        var Lang = lang[0].toUpperCase() + lang.slice(1)
        $(this).before('<div class="codelabel ' + lang + '">' + Lang + ' code</div>' +
                        '<div class="codelabelspacer"></div>')
    })
}
$( document ).ready(addLang)

    border: 2px solid white;

title: "Add a language label to code chunks in pkgdown articles"

<p>
pkgdown nicely renders code chunks in your package's documentation
website. However, if you mix in non-R code snippets in your articles, it is
difficult to distinguish R code chunks from those written in other
languages. How nice would it be if each code chunk would have a small label to
indicate its content's language.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a> is super useful for documenting your R packages. It is particularly well
suited to showcase small code examples. In some of my projects, on top of R code
chunks, I also provide code examples in other languages such as short Linux
command line code snippets I used to preprocess data before loading it into R.
</p>

<p>
pkgdown renders code chunks in most common languages nicely, with syntax
highlighting, etc. However, it does not indicate what language is used in a
particular code chunk. For most projects, this is not a problem, because all
code chunks are R code anyway. But this behavior gets confusing when we mix
different languages in the same document.

<p>
To solve this issue, I wrote a small javascript hook that adds small labels to
each code chunk, indicating the language of its content. The hook comprises a
short jQuery function and some CSS instructions. Simply add the two snippets
below to your <code>pkgdown/extra.js</code> and <code>pkgdown/extra.css</code> to add the labels to
your pkgdown projects.
